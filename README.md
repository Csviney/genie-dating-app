# Genie Dating App

**Genie** is a dating app that allows users to create and login into a *Profile* in which enter information about themselves, including age, bio, and gender, and find other Profiles filtered based on their inputted gender preferences. **Genie** will automatically create a *Match* when two Profiles 'like' each other, which generates a Compatibility Score, using a [Love Calculator 3rd Party API](https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/love-calculator). 

After creating their *Profile* and receiving *Matches*, Users can edit their own *Profile*, as well as customize the name of their *Matches*. Users can also delete their own *Profile* and *Matches*.
